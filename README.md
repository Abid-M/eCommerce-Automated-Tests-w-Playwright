## Overview ![Test workflow](https://github.com/Abid-M/eCommerce-Automated-Tests-w-Playwright/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)
This project develops end-to-end tests using Playwright for an e-commerce website. The tests simulate user interactions like purchasing items, applying discounts, and verifying order details.

### Test Cases:
#### Test Case 1:
- Login to the e-commerce site as a registered user
- Add an item to the cart
- Apply a discount code 'edgewords' and verify the discount
- Verify that the total after discount & shipping is correct
- Log out

#### Test Case 2:
- Login to the e-commerce site as a registered user
- Add an item to the cart and proceed to checkout
- Complete billing details and select payment method
- Capture the order number and verify its presence in the 'My Orders' section
- Log out

## Pre-requisites
Before running the tests, make sure to manually register a new account on the [e-commerce site](https://www.edgewordstraining.co.uk/demo-site/my-account/).

## Website
The tests will be conducted on the following e-commerce site:
- [Edgewords Demo Site](https://www.edgewordstraining.co.uk/demo-site/)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Abid-M/eCommerce-Automated-Tests-w-Playwright.git
```
   
2. Install the following packages with `npm install`
     
3. Create a `.env` file containing:
   - `EMAIL='RegisteredEmail'`
   - `PASSWORD='AccountPassword'`
     - `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` must be the registered login details
     
5. Run the test with `npx playwright test --workers=1` or via the VSC Test Explorer
   - Workers is set to 1 because there is only one account being used so the tests will fail each other since they are not being run in isolation.
